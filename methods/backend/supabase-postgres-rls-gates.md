# Supabase Postgres RLS Gates

## Purpose

Define the minimum safety gates for Supabase, Postgres, auth, RLS, query, and migration work before implementation or review claims.

## When To Use

Use when a task touches Supabase projects, Postgres schema or queries, RLS policies, auth/session behavior, storage access, migrations, generated database types, public payloads, or database performance.

## When Not To Use

Do not use for frontend-only changes, static docs changes, or backend work that does not touch data access, auth, persistence, or database behavior.

## Agent Roles That Should Embed It

Backend Contract Agent, Database RLS Agent, Security Agent, QA Test Agent, Reviewer Agent.

## Operating Rules

- Start by classifying the data surface: public, authenticated user, tenant-scoped, admin-only, or service-role-only.
- Verify the current source of truth before database guidance: local migrations, generated types, Supabase docs, and project-specific repo instructions.
- Treat RLS, auth, storage, and public API payloads as security surfaces, not just backend implementation details.
- Treat Supabase Data API/table exposure as a public API boundary. Inventory exposed tables, views, RPC/functions, generated clients, and anon/authenticated access before claiming private-data safety.
- Prefer read-only inspection until the migration or SQL change is explicitly in scope.
- Never run live SQL, migrations, seed scripts, Supabase CLI commands, MCP actions, or project config changes without explicit approval and a rollback path.
- For query-performance work, identify the query shape, indexes, row volume assumptions, locking/concurrency risk, and expected evidence before proposing changes.
- For migrations, check reversibility, schema constraints, data backfill impact, generated type drift, staging/production differences, and whether policies need to change with schema.
- Review SECURITY DEFINER functions for owner, search path, caller role, least privilege, input validation, and RLS bypass risk.
- Verify auth helper assumptions against current official Supabase docs before depending on role/session behavior in policy or API decisions.
- Treat BOLA/object-ownership checks and npm/package supply-chain changes as security gates when Supabase client, API, or generated-type behavior is affected.
- Stop if service-role keys, JWT secrets, database URLs, auth config, or private payloads are needed but not explicitly authorized.

## Verification Requirements

Report the data surface, files or migrations reviewed, RLS/auth/storage implications, docs freshness status, validation command or reason it could not run, and remaining manual checks. For implementation work, include migration/test evidence and any rollback or recovery notes.

## Risks / Anti-Patterns

Weakening RLS, assuming local schema matches production, running live mutations during review, exposing service-role credentials, treating generated types as optional after schema changes, or optimizing queries without evidence.

## Source Inspiration / License Status

Inspired by the reviewed Supabase Agent Skills source record. GitHub API reported MIT for that source. This method is normalized/paraphrased toolkit guidance, not raw upstream activation.
