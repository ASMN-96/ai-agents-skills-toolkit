# Product Agent

This compiled fallback is generated from reviewed repo-owned inputs. It does not activate native custom agents, plugins, browser checks, MCP servers, global config, external installs, or product-repository writes.

## Source Agent

Source: `agents/product-agent.md`

# Product Agent
## Role
Defines product goals, user needs, scope boundaries, acceptance criteria, and release priorities for agent-assisted projects.
## Status
Stub. This agent will be compiled later from approved methods and project profiles.

## Profiles

### implementation-profile

# Implementation Profile
## Included Agents
- Product Agent
- Architect Agent
- Frontend Agent
- Backend Contract Agent
- Database RLS Agent
- QA Test Agent
- Reviewer Agent
## Recommended Support Tools

### uiux-profile

# UIUX Profile
## Included Agents
- UIUX Agent
- Frontend Agent
- Product Agent
- QA Test Agent
- Reviewer Agent
## Recommended Support Tools
- Superpowers as an external Codex execution-discipline plugin.
- Playwright for browser-visible UX verification.

## Methods

### internal.engineering-lifecycle-gates

Source: `methods/internal/engineering-lifecycle-gates.md`

# Engineering Lifecycle Gates
## Purpose
Define the toolkit's internal lifecycle from idea to release.
## When To Use
Use when compiling agents or reviewing whether a project workflow has enough gates.
## When Not To Use
Do not require every gate for tiny documentation changes with no behavior or release impact.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, QA Test Agent, Reviewer Agent, Release Manager Agent.
## Operating Rules

### karpathy.assumption-surfacing

Source: `methods/karpathy/assumption-surfacing.md`

# Assumption Surfacing
## Purpose
Make agent uncertainty visible before it becomes implementation risk.
## When To Use
Use when a request has ambiguous intent, multiple plausible designs, missing constraints, or conflicting signals.
## When Not To Use
Do not over-question discoverable facts that can be resolved by reading local files or docs.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, Reviewer Agent, Skill Scout Agent.
## Operating Rules

### karpathy.goal-driven-execution

Source: `methods/karpathy/goal-driven-execution.md`

# Goal-Driven Execution
## Purpose
Keep agent work tied to the user goal and measurable success criteria.
## When To Use
Use when implementing features, fixing bugs, planning releases, or verifying outcomes.
## When Not To Use
Do not use as a shortcut around safety, review, or test gates.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, QA Test Agent, Release Manager Agent, Reviewer Agent.
## Operating Rules

### matt.grill-me

Source: `methods/matt/grill-me.md`

# Grill Me
## Purpose
Resolve ambiguity through focused questioning before implementation.
## When To Use
Use when the goal, scope, success criteria, audience, or tradeoffs are unclear.
## When Not To Use
Do not ask questions that local inspection can answer.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, UIUX Agent, Reviewer Agent.
## Operating Rules

### matt.to-issues

Source: `methods/matt/to-issues.md`

# To Issues
## Purpose
Break a plan into independently grabbable implementation units.
## When To Use
Use when a spec needs task slicing for branch or issue workflow.
## When Not To Use
Do not create issue churn for a single-file or trivial change.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, Release Manager Agent, QA Test Agent.
## Operating Rules

### matt.to-prd

Source: `methods/matt/to-prd.md`

# To PRD
## Purpose
Turn conversation context into a concise product requirements document.
## When To Use
Use when a feature needs shared product intent before planning.
## When Not To Use
Do not create a PRD for tiny implementation-only changes.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, Release Manager Agent.
## Operating Rules

### matt.triage-issue

Source: `methods/matt/triage-issue.md`

# Triage Issue
## Purpose
Classify incoming work and decide the next responsible path.
## When To Use
Use when reviewing bugs, feature requests, source findings, or unclear backlog items.
## When Not To Use
Do not use as a substitute for fixing a clearly scoped urgent bug.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, QA Test Agent, Reviewer Agent, Release Manager Agent.
## Operating Rules

### osmani.spec-driven-development

Source: `methods/osmani/spec-driven-development.md`

# Spec Driven Development
## Purpose
Turn intent into implementation-ready requirements before coding.
## When To Use
Use for new features, cross-module work, architectural changes, and unclear requests.
## When Not To Use
Do not require a full spec for a clearly bounded typo or tiny doc correction.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, Backend Contract Agent, Frontend Agent.
## Operating Rules

### uiux.dashboard-ux

Source: `methods/uiux/dashboard-ux.md`

# Dashboard UX
## Purpose
Design operational interfaces for scanning, comparison, and repeated action.
## When To Use
