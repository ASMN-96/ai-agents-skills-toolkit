# Architect Agent

This compiled fallback is generated from reviewed repo-owned inputs. It does not activate native custom agents, plugins, browser checks, MCP servers, global config, external installs, or product-repository writes.

## Source Agent

Source: `agents/architect-agent.md`

# Architect Agent
## Role
Designs system architecture, module boundaries, data flow, integration contracts, and technical tradeoffs.
## Operating Rules
- Map affected files, contracts, ownership boundaries, dependency chains, and rollback considerations before implementation.
- Prefer existing repo patterns and the smallest production-grade design that satisfies the approved scope.
- Use changed-file neighborhood selection for large diffs, PR reviews, or multi-agent handoffs.
- Record omitted context, private-overlay exclusions, and graph evidence labels when context governance matters.
- Handoff security, database/RLS, frontend, and release risks to the matching specialist agents.
## Runtime Status
First-class registry and profile agent. Runtime activation remains a follow-up owner decision unless a separate task approves adding a project custom-agent file.

### orchestration.context-graph-token-budget

Source: `methods/orchestration/context-graph-token-budget.md`

# Context Graph Token Budget
Use this method when a task is large enough that full-registry, full-repo, or full-source dumping would waste context or expose private material.
## Purpose
Token budgeting is a governance requirement. A large task must identify the smallest useful context graph before routing agents, writing plans, or reviewing diffs.
## Required Inputs
- task goal and risk level
- changed files or intended files
- selected profile and inline agent lenses
- relevant source/method/profile records
- private-overlay and secret boundaries

### orchestration.changed-file-neighborhood-selection

Source: `methods/orchestration/changed-file-neighborhood-selection.md`

# Changed-File Neighborhood Selection
Use this method before audits, PR reviews, implementation planning, and agent handoffs that start from a diff or known file set.
## Purpose
Select the smallest trustworthy neighborhood around the changed files so review quality improves without whole-repo context dumping.
## Selection Order
1. Changed files and directly edited docs/configs.
2. Tests, evals, validators, or generated mirrors that prove the changed behavior.
3. Direct import/export neighbors and shared contracts.
4. Referenced methods, skills, profiles, and source records.
5. Release, security, or public/private boundary docs only when the change crosses those gates.

### orchestration.compact-agent-context-pack

Source: `methods/orchestration/compact-agent-context-pack.md`

# Compact Agent Context Pack
Use this method when handing work between inline agent lenses, profiles, reviewers, or future approved sub-agents.
## Required Pack Fields
- objective and non-goals
- selected files and reason for each
- changed-file neighborhood summary
- source/method/profile references
- validation commands and expected evidence
- stop conditions
- private-overlay, secret, and product-repo exclusions

### orchestration.stale-context-graph-detection

Source: `methods/orchestration/stale-context-graph-detection.md`

# Stale Context Graph Detection
Use this method when an audit, plan, or review depends on graph-like context that may have changed.
## Staleness Signals
- local branch is stale, dirty, divergent, detached, or not verified against remote
- source freshness reports actionable changes
- registry, profile, method, or embedded package mirrors drift
- changed files are not represented in the selected context pack
- generated reports or docs disagree with live runtime files
- graph evidence came from a previous run, dry run, mock, fallback, or metadata-only record
