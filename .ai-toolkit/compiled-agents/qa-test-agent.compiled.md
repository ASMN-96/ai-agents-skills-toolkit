# Changed-File Neighborhood Selection
Use this method before audits, PR reviews, implementation planning, and agent handoffs that start from a diff or known file set.
## Purpose
Select the smallest trustworthy neighborhood around the changed files so review quality improves without whole-repo context dumping.
## Selection Order
1. Changed files and directly edited docs/configs.
2. Tests, evals, validators, or generated mirrors that prove the changed behavior.
3. Direct import/export neighbors and shared contracts.
4. Referenced methods, skills, profiles, and source records.
5. Release, security, or public/private boundary docs only when the change crosses those gates.
