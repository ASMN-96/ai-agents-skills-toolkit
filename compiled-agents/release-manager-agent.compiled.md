# Release Manager Agent

This compiled fallback is generated from reviewed repo-owned inputs. It does not activate native custom agents, plugins, browser checks, MCP servers, global config, external installs, or product-repository writes.

## Source Agent

Source: `agents/release-manager-agent.md`

# Release Manager Agent
## Role
Coordinates release readiness, versioning, changelog entries, release gates, rollback notes, and project sync approval.
## Status
Stub. This agent will be compiled later from approved methods and project profiles.

## Profiles

### release-profile

# Release Profile
## Included Agents
- Release Manager Agent
- Reviewer Agent
- QA Test Agent
- Security Agent
- SRE Performance Agent
## Recommended Support Tools
- Superpowers as an external Codex execution-discipline plugin.
- GitHub checks for PR and CI status.

### implementation-profile

# Implementation Profile
## Included Agents
- Product Agent
- Architect Agent
- Frontend Agent
- Backend Contract Agent
- Database RLS Agent
- QA Test Agent
- Reviewer Agent
## Recommended Support Tools

## Methods

### internal.engineering-lifecycle-gates

Source: `methods/internal/engineering-lifecycle-gates.md`

# Engineering Lifecycle Gates
## Purpose
Define the toolkit's internal lifecycle from idea to release.
## When To Use
Use when compiling agents or reviewing whether a project workflow has enough gates.
## When Not To Use
Do not require every gate for tiny documentation changes with no behavior or release impact.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, QA Test Agent, Reviewer Agent, Release Manager Agent.
## Operating Rules

### internal.skill-anatomy

Source: `methods/internal/skill-anatomy.md`

# Skill Anatomy
## Purpose
Define what makes a reusable skill or method easy for agents to discover, load, and apply.
## When To Use
Use when creating toolkit methods, future skills, profiles, or compiled agent inputs.
## When Not To Use
Do not use to activate raw external skills or bypass source evaluation.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Skill Scout Agent, Architect Agent, Release Manager Agent.
## Operating Rules

### karpathy.goal-driven-execution

Source: `methods/karpathy/goal-driven-execution.md`

# Goal-Driven Execution
## Purpose
Keep agent work tied to the user goal and measurable success criteria.
## When To Use
Use when implementing features, fixing bugs, planning releases, or verifying outcomes.
## When Not To Use
Do not use as a shortcut around safety, review, or test gates.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, QA Test Agent, Release Manager Agent, Reviewer Agent.
## Operating Rules

### matt.git-guardrails

Source: `methods/matt/git-guardrails.md`

# Git Guardrails
## Purpose
Keep branch, commit, and push behavior deliberate.
## When To Use
Use before staging, committing, pushing, or opening a PR.
## When Not To Use
Do not use to bypass project-specific release policy.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Release Manager Agent, Reviewer Agent, QA Test Agent.
## Operating Rules

### matt.to-issues

Source: `methods/matt/to-issues.md`

# To Issues
## Purpose
Break a plan into independently grabbable implementation units.
## When To Use
Use when a spec needs task slicing for branch or issue workflow.
## When Not To Use
Do not create issue churn for a single-file or trivial change.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, Release Manager Agent, QA Test Agent.
## Operating Rules

### matt.to-prd

Source: `methods/matt/to-prd.md`

# To PRD
## Purpose
Turn conversation context into a concise product requirements document.
## When To Use
Use when a feature needs shared product intent before planning.
## When Not To Use
Do not create a PRD for tiny implementation-only changes.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, Architect Agent, Release Manager Agent.
## Operating Rules

### matt.triage-issue

Source: `methods/matt/triage-issue.md`

# Triage Issue
## Purpose
Classify incoming work and decide the next responsible path.
## When To Use
Use when reviewing bugs, feature requests, source findings, or unclear backlog items.
## When Not To Use
Do not use as a substitute for fixing a clearly scoped urgent bug.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Product Agent, QA Test Agent, Reviewer Agent, Release Manager Agent.
## Operating Rules

### osmani.shipping-launch

Source: `methods/osmani/shipping-launch.md`

# Shipping And Launch
## Purpose
Prepare changes for controlled release.
## When To Use
Use when a feature, migration, or workflow is ready for production or project sync.
## When Not To Use
Do not use for local-only drafts that are not ready for review.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Release Manager Agent, SRE Performance Agent, QA Test Agent, Reviewer Agent.
## Operating Rules

### security.differential-security-review

Source: `methods/security/differential-security-review.md`

# Differential Security Review
## Purpose
Review changed code by risk first, focusing security effort where the diff can alter trust boundaries, access control, secrets, public payloads, or supply-chain behavior.
## When To Use
Use for PR review, dependency changes, auth/security-sensitive diffs, public API changes, database policy changes, external calls, validation changes, payment/value-transfer logic, cryptography, file upload/download paths, or configuration that changes runtime exposure.
## When Not To Use
Do not use as a full audit of unrelated code when the user asked for a narrow typo, formatting, or docs-only change with no security surface. Do not use it to run external scanners or install security tooling unless separately approved.
## Agent Roles That Should Embed It
Security Agent, Reviewer Agent, Backend Contract Agent, Database RLS Agent, Release Manager Agent.
## Operating Rules
