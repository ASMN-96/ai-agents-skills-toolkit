# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation and Skill Scout Agent

Create the toolkit structure, governance rules, safety boundaries, checklists, templates, documentation, and the first internal agent: Skill Scout Agent.

## Phase 2: Source Evaluation

Use Skill Scout Agent to evaluate candidate external skills, GitHub repositories, official docs, marketplaces, and community sources without installing, cloning, activating, or running them.

Status: Completed as read-only evaluation. Summary lives in `PHASE_2_SOURCE_EVALUATION_SUMMARY.md`; source records live under `sources/`.

## Phase 3: Method Extraction

Extract approved concepts into modular methods after review. Keep extracted methods separate from raw external source files.

Status: In progress on `phase3-method-extraction`. Outputs are normalized/paraphrased method files only, with source inspiration and license status documented in each method.

## Phase 4: Agent Compilation

Compile internal agents from approved methods, profiles, prompts, and governance rules. Record toolkit version metadata in compiled outputs.

Phase 4 must not start until Phase 3 methods are reviewed and approved.

## Phase 5: Project Sync / Install Workflow

Create intentional, version-pinned sync and install workflows for project repositories. Project repos consume compiled agents, not raw upstream files.
